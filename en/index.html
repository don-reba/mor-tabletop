						<h1>The Bachelor</h1>
						<a href="img/card_03_en.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img src="img/card_03_en.jpg" alt="" /></a>
						<p>The first is Daniil Dankovsky, a Bachelor of medicine and a young doctor from the Capital. He has precision instruments, a scientific worldview, and is respected by the ruling families of the Town.</p>

						<h1>The Haruspex</h1>
						<a href="img/card_02_en.jpg" data-featherlight="image"><img src="img/card_02_en.jpg" alt="" /></a>
						<p>The second is Artemiy Burakh, a Haruspex who knows how to read animals’ entrails and has shamanic heritage. He was born here, went away to study medicine, and has recently come back. The skills of his steppe forefathers will help him fight the Plague.</p>

						<p>The third is Clara, The Changeling; a girl who has no past and can heal or murder with her touch. A fraud to some people, a saint to others. Where science and authority fail, mysticism enters the picture.</p>

			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<h2>About this game</h2>
			<p><strong>The Pathologic tabletop game</strong> is currently under development. We are still searching for the final form it will take. So please be aware that some interface choices are subject to change and assets presented above (tokens, cards, etc) may be altered.</p>
			<h2>About us</h2>
			<p><strong>Ice-Pick Lodge</strong> is a Russian game development studio founded in 2002. Our general philosophy is that games should give players food for thought, not just fun. We have never produced a board game before, but now we have found skilled designers ready to translate a digital story into chips and paper. That’s how tabletop Pathologic came to be.</p>
